**Powerful hierarchical vision transformers based on sliding window attention.**

Neighborhood Attention (NA, local attention) was introduced in our original paper, 
[NAT](NAT.md), and runs efficiently with our CUDA extension to PyTorch, [NATTEN](NATTEN.md).

We recently introduced a new model, [DiNAT](DiNAT.md), which extends NA by dilating neighborhoods (DiNA, sparse global attention).

Combinations of NA/DiNA are capable of preserving locality, 
expanding the receptive field exponentially, 
and capturing longer-range inter-dependencies, 
leading to significant performance boosts in downstream vision tasks.

A new hierarchical vision transformer based on Neighborhood Attention (local attention) and Dilated Neighborhood Attention (sparse global attention) that enjoys significant performance boost in downstream tasks.

Check out the [DiNAT README](DiNAT.md).

Our original paper, [Neighborhood Attention Transformer (NAT)](NAT.md), the first efficient sliding-window local attention.

# How Neighborhood Attention works
Neighborhood Attention localizes the query token's (red) receptive field to its nearest neighboring tokens in the key-value pair (green). 
This is equivalent to dot-product self attention when the neighborhood size is identical to the image dimensions. 
Note that the edges are special (edge) cases.

# News

### September 29, 2022
* New preprint: [Dilated Neighborhood Attention Transformer](DiNAT.md).
* [NA CUDA extension v0.13](NATTEN.md) released with dilation support!
  * See [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

### July 9, 2022
* [NA CUDA extension v0.12](NATTEN.md) released.
  * NA runs much more efficiently now, up to 40% faster and uses up to 25% less memory compared to Swin Transformerâ€™s Shifted Window Self Attention.
  * Improved FP16 throughput.
  * Improved training speed and stability.
  * See [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).
  
### May 12, 2022
* [1-D Neighborhood Attention](NATTEN.md) support added!
* Moved the kernel to `natten/` now, since there's a single version for all three tasks, and we're adding more features to the extension.

### April 30, 2022
* [NA CUDA extension v0.11](NATTEN.md) released.
  * It's faster in both training and inference, 
  * with a single version for all three tasks (no downstream-specific version)
* [PyTorch implementation](NATTEN.md) released
  * Works both with and without CUDA, but not very efficient. Try to use the CUDA extension when possible.
  * See [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).
